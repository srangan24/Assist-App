# The Assist App
The Assist app in an Android application that is targeted at helping the elderly. With a simplistic user interface that matches its target audience, Assist provides an easy to use method of emergency communication. This app was developed by team PantherHacks at MetroHacks IV.
## Emergency Function
Emergencies can be triggered by one of two ways: 
1.  Through self-report by pressing a button
2.  Through rapid change in acceleration followed by no change measured using the phone's in-built accelerometer (in case the user falls and loses consciousness)

Once an emergency is activated, a push notification is sent to the user, confirming if there is an emergency or not. If there is no reseponse in a certain time-frame a series of automated actions will entail. The phone will automatically call 911 to connect the user to a dispatch officer, as well as send a text message alert to selected friends and family, notifying them of the emergency as well as the specific location at which it took place (using latitude and longitude).
## Contacts Page
The user has the oppurtunity to add spcific people to be contacted in the case of an emergency. This is doen through the app's settings page. Here, the user will have the option to select any person in their contacts. Their mobile phone number and name will be stored in the app if they are selected. These stored files will have the information on who to contact through text in the case of an emergency. 
The user also has the ability to remove people from their emergency contacts list if desired.
